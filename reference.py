 reference.py - Booking Reference Generation Module
==============================================================================
Module      : FC723 - Programming Theory
Assignment  : Final Project - Part B, Task B.1

Contains the algorithm used to generate a random, GUARANTEED-UNIQUE
8-character alphanumeric booking reference.

ALGORITHM
---------
generate_booking_reference() builds an 8-character string using
random.choices() drawn from the pool of uppercase letters A-Z and
digits 0-9 (36 possible characters per position, so 36^8 ~= 2.8 x 10^12
possible combinations). To make uniqueness a GUARANTEE rather than
just "very likely", every candidate is checked against the bookings
already stored in the database (is_reference_taken()) and, in the
rare case of a collision, discarded in favour of a freshly generated
one. The retry loop is bounded by MAX_ATTEMPTS purely as a safety net
against an almost-full reference space, which will never realistically
occur in this system.

    Generate a random, unique 8-character alphanumeric booking reference.

    Steps
    -----
    1. Randomly choose 8 characters from A-Z and 0-9 using
       random.choices() (uniform distribution, with replacement).
    2. Join them into a single 8-character candidate string.
    3. Check the database via is_reference_taken(): if the candidate
       already exists, discard it and try again (step 1).
    4. Repeat until a reference that is NOT already in the database
       is produced, or until MAX_ATTEMPTS is reached (safety net).

    Parameters
    ----------
    connection : sqlite3.Connection
        An open connection to the bookings database, used to verify
        uniqueness against existing bookings.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        A unique 8-character alphanumeric booking reference.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If a unique reference could not be produced after MAX_ATTEMPTS
        tries (would only happen if the reference space were almost
        entirely exhausted, which is not realistic for this system).
